# Assignment 3 – Portfolio Web Application

## Description
A personal portfolio web application that showcases my projects and integrates with the GitHub API.  
It demonstrates:
- External API integration
- Complex UI logic (filtering, sorting, validation)
- Client-side state management (theme, visitor name, UI visibility)

## Features
- View local projects with filter and sort controls (by type, date, and difficulty).
- See latest repositories fetched from my GitHub profile (GitHub REST API).
- Dark/light mode toggle stored in `localStorage`.
- Visitor name greeting stored in `localStorage`.
- Contact form with validation (name, email, and message).
- Timer showing how long you have been on the site.
- Show/hide projects state remembered.

## Running the Project Locally
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yazeedkfupm/assignment-3.git
   cd assignment-3
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (you can double-click it or use a simple HTTP server).

   Example using Python:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
